**Overview**  
`docker-compose` (hyphenated) and `docker compose` (space-separated) both manage multi-container Docker apps, but they
represent different versions with distinct implementations. The hyphenated form is the legacy standalone tool, while the
spaced form is the modern integrated CLI subcommand. [iifx](https://iifx.dev/en/articles/375567004)

**Key Versions**

- `docker-compose` is Docker Compose V1, released in 2014 and Python-based; it's now deprecated and requires separate
  installation. [dev](https://dev.to/ajeetraina/comment/2fh86)
- `docker compose` is V2 (since 2020), rewritten in Go, and built into the Docker CLI like `docker build` or `docker run`.

**Command Differences**  
| Aspect | `docker-compose` (V1) | `docker compose` (V2) | |--------|-----------------------|-----------------------| |
Syntax | Standalone binary: `docker-compose up` [iifx](https://iifx.dev/en/articles/375567004) | CLI plugin:
`docker compose up` [iifx](https://iifx.dev/en/articles/375567004) | | File Names | Often `docker-compose.yml`
[iifx](https://iifx.dev/en/articles/375567004) | Prefers `compose.yaml` or `compose.yml`
[iifx](https://iifx.dev/en/articles/375567004) | | Project Naming | Appends "\_" (e.g., `myproj_web`)

Appends "-" (e.g., `myproj-web`)

**Features and Support**  
V2 offers better performance, Swarm/K8s integration, `watch` mode for dev reloads, and ongoing updates; use it for new
projects. V1 lacks these and may cause compatibility issues with modern Docker. Docker recommends migrating to V2 via
`docker compose`. [codegenes](https://www.codegenes.net/blog/difference-between-docker-compose-and-docker-compose/)
